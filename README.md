# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview


## Resources


## Results
Describe the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models.

- evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk.
  - Random Oversampler
  - SMOTE
  - Cluster centroids
  
- use SMOTEENN algorithm to determine if the results from the combinatorial approach are better at predicting credit risk than the above resampling algorithms 

- Compare classifiers using BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk and evaluate each model.

## Summary

- summary of the results
- a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification
